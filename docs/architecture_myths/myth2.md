# Myth 2: Kubernetes Clusters Can't Function Without Kube-Proxy
You deploy a Kubernetes cluster and start checking the usual system components. API server? Running. Controller manager? Running. Kube-Proxy? Wait… it's missing! You double-check the namespace, logs, and even the deployment—nothing. But surprisingly, your pods and services are still communicating just fine. How is this possible? Isn't Kube-Proxy essential for cluster networking?

### Why This Myth Exists?
1. **Kube-Proxy is enabled by default** in most Kubernetes distributions, making it appear mandatory.
2. **Traditional Kubernetes networking relies on iptables or IPVS,** which are managed by Kube-Proxy, reinforcing its perceived necessity.
3. **Many engineers are unaware of eBPF-based networking solutions,** such as Cilium, which can entirely replace Kube-Proxy while improving performance and scalability.

### Reality
- Kube-Proxy is a **default networking component** in Kubernetes, but it is not mandatory for cluster functionality. Kubernetes networking is designed to support multiple implementations, and modern solutions can replace Kube-Proxy entirely.
- Newer networking models, such as **eBPF-based CNIs (e.g., Cilium, Calico eBPF, and Katran),** bypass the need for Kube-Proxy by directly handling packet processing within the kernel. These solutions not only eliminate the dependency on iptables/IPVS but also improve performance, scalability, and security by reducing latency and enabling fine-grained traffic control.
- **Many high-performance Kubernetes clusters**—especially those optimized for large-scale workloads—choose to disable Kube-Proxy in favor of these more efficient networking alternatives.

### Experiment & Validate
**Step 1: Disable Kube-Proxy**
Scale down Kube-Proxy to remove it from the cluster:
```
kubectl -n kube-system scale deployment kube-proxy --replicas=0
```

**Step 2: Install Cilium Without Kube-Proxy**
Use Cilium as a replacement, enabling eBPF-based networking:
```
helm install cilium cilium/cilium --set kubeProxyReplacement=strict
```

**Step 3: Deploy a Service and Test Connectivity**
Create an Nginx pod and expose it as a service:
```
kubectl run nginx --image=nginx --port=80 --expose
```

Now, check if the service works without Kube-Proxy:
```
kubectl run test-pod --image=busybox --restart=Never --rm -it -- wget -qO- nginx
```
If successful, you’ll see the Nginx welcome page, proving that Kubernetes networking works without Kube-Proxy.

### Key Takeaways
- **Kube-Proxy is NOT mandatory**—Kubernetes networking can function without it.
- **eBPF-based CNIs (Cilium, Calico eBPF, etc.) can fully replace Kube-Proxy**, offering better performance and scalability.
- **Choosing the right networking approach is crucial**—understanding Kubernetes networking beyond Kube-Proxy helps optimize cluster efficiency, security, and observability.
